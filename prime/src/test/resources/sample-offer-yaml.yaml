#
# This is a sample YAML format to be used by
# agents that produce offers.  The general idea
# is that an offer has a set of parameters,
# and also a set of selected subscribers that will
# get it.
#
# YAML was chosen since it's more human readable than
# e.g. json or protobuffers, while still being
# easy to produce by an agent, and relatively compact,
# in particular when gzipped.

# # All of the parameters below are just copied from the firebasr
# # realtime database we used in the demo, converted to
# # camel case.  All the fields should be documented
# # in this document, and we should think through if this is
# # the best set of parameters we went.

offer:
     # XXX This offer does not have an ID, but if we were just
     #     updating the list of members of the segment, it would
     #     make sense to have an OfferID, or something that refers
     #     to a previously created offer.  That id should be created
     #     by the importer, and used by the agent when updating
     #     membership.   If any other parameters are going to be
     #     changed, it is necessary to produce a new offer.
     #     It may make sense to put the ID in the url when
     #     when we update (PUT method) changes, but then the
     #     ID in the yaml will be redundant.   Figure out how to
     #     do this one way or another and just do it.
