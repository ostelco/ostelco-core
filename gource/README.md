# Generate a gource animation of the develop branch


This directory contains a script to generate a ["gource"](https://gource.io/)
animation of the commits that have gone into making this project.

The script "generate-mpeg.sh" checks if the prerequisite executables
are present in the runtime environment, and if it is will proceed too generate
a mpeg movie illustrating the evolution of the project.  The output will
be placed in a file called "ostelco-core.mpeg" in the same directory as
the script is being run from.
