# Exploratory code for understanding the eSIM protocols

Based on information from
https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/SGP.22-v2.0.pdf

... Can the JSON files be interpreted as swagger spec, and be
converted into a server/client implementation?  If so can we use it to
flesh out the interaction between the BSS and the SM-DP+?

Use json schema files (stored in the resources directory of the
source code) to verify that the input / output is conformant to the
GSMA spec.  Use jackson's ordinary methods for handling incoming
requests and replies.

TODO (Prioritized)

* Make class comments for every high level class.

* Make an acceptance test that lets the service run in conjunction with
  an ESP where the ESP terminates the SSL, using a client certificate,
  as we are doing today using the dropwizard-terminated SSL.   The test will
  have to send sufficient information in headers to the service so that it 
  can still identify the incoming user.  It seems that this will have to be a
  two-step process:

  1. Get the ESP to run locally in some trivial fashion, forwarding requests
  to the sim management service:

      https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/running-esp-localdev

  2. Then modify the ESP to accept client certificate authenticated
  connections, and modify headers of forwarded requests to identify which
  certificate has been used:

       https://fardog.io/blog/2017/12/30/client-side-certificate-authentication-with-nginx/

* Make junit-tests that runs the dropwizard application in a mode to permit it
  to accept TSL connections that are signed by a self-signed certificate,
  using a certificate chain where the signing authority is included.  The tests
  should as far as possible use standard configurations of both 
  dropwizard and the jersey client to make this happen.  A script describing
  how to generate new signed certificates should also be included.

  Look here for description on how to make this happen
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34908947/dropwizard-client-certificate-authentication-via-httpclient-key-trust-store

  Question: Can we run kotlin scripts as docker containers, and if we can, would
  that make it simpler to make the little things we need to serve as an execution
  environment during testing?


TODO (not prioritized)
---

* Think _very_hard_  about how to make an acceptance test for this thing.   It should
   * Have a minimum of different executables.
   * Preferably run in Docker Compose, but kubernetes is also an option.
   * Generate a clear-cut test result, preferably in junit, preferable with coverage.
   * Should be simple to run from the command line, no magic necessary.

* General refactoring, weed out TODOs, make constants, set protocol versions
  correctly etc.

* Authentication:
   * Design certificate structure (SM-DP+, CSR  created by whom, signed by whom
     etc.)   Figure out how and where these certs should be stored.
   * Same thing for HSS.
   * Make test certificates that are self-signed and are included in the
     acceptance tests.
   * Document the whole procedure using markdown and plant uml.

* Make a docker compose testable ensemble of executables for acceptance test. 

 *  Must contain:

    * A sim inventory service, the test article, with a config file.
    * SIM admin database, running in postgres, and sufficient script support to
      start it up with the appropriate database schema installed.
    * SM-DP+ server. Very simplified, serving
      a highly restricted set of usecases.   Must be capable of reporting
      back to client about what happens.   Must therefore use a valid
      certificate structure.
    * An HSS emulator, that the sim inventory can talk to to enable
      sim profiles.
    * An .out file that can be injected into the Sim admin database
      as the first step of the acceptance test.
    * A script emulating the behavior of Prime talking to the
      the SIM inventory.  Not necessarily Prime, but should use
      the same libraries that we intend to be used from Prime.
    * Some mechanism that will deliver the results of running the acceptance
      tests to a surrounding environment that can determine if the test
      ran to  completion or not.

 *  Nice to have:

    * Prometheus integration

* Return channel for ES2+

   * Figure out where we want to place the return channel for ES2+
   * Set up the certificates, CSRs etc.
   * Set up a first version that does nothing but receiving the information
     and write it to a log (that is then picked up by the standard
     logging interfaces).  This should be a version of the sim inventory server,
     but it should run in a mode that is made just for this usecase.
   * Later (possibly much later), write code that mutates the common
     data model, or publishes updates to an internal bus of some sort.


* Make code that generates QR Code as picture (png?) that can be embedded
  in an user interface.

* Code walkthrough of usecases, all the way down into database structures.
   * Must be done asap by the dev team.

* Documentation
  * The documentation should by and large be written in markdown and 
    plant UML.
  * A domain model for the SIM cards and their life cycle.
  * API documentation with all parameters throroughly described, and 
    examples of use.

* Instrumentation
  * Expose metrics to Prometheus via standard techniques

* Integration to live test-SM-DP+
  * Complete an SM-DP+ communications class that contains both health
    check and metrics for communications overhead. Use standard 
    dropwizard mechanisms for this.
  
  * Figure out how to do heartbeat. Must ask SM-DP+ vendor about this.  Must be 
    done over ES2+ protocol.

  * First goal to aim for is to provision a test profile to a live commercial
    handset.

* Integration to live HSS
  * Authentication
  * Heartvbeat
  * Instrumentation
  * Synchronization with datamodel (misc. states for SIM).
   

* Sync design of internal API with requirements from user interface flow
   => ... then ruthlessly prune elements that are not required for
   UX or testing.


Ideas
---

* Think this through: Would it make sense to have emulators for
  the HSS and SM-DP+es we will integrate to, just to see that the 
  system is capable of connecting to them using the appropriate
  set of certificates etc.?

* Follow through on https://rohannagar.github.io/2018-04-11/dropwizard-on-kubernetes

* docker build -t ostelco/simadmin . 
  ... to build a new version of the simadmin thingy that is
  also reachable by kubernetes locally.

* Re-enable json schema validation on  everything, fixing the broken 
  schemas in the process.

* Make some refactoring in the data structures. 

* Use the generated openapi spec to generate clients.

* Add  and test two-way SSL authentication.

* Make test-runs of some typical client/SM-DP+ interactions,
  possibly logging them using plant uml autogenerated
  diagrams.

* Connect to proper SM-DP+, watch everything explode
  ... observe fix repeat until it's working.

* Integrate into a proper workflow for subscriber signup,
  possibly involving generation of QR-codes :-)

* Figure out how to integrate with prime, possibly making the whole thing
  a part of prime.

* Figure out how to expose endpoints using google cloud endpoints, and
  preserving authentication for incoming ES2+ callbacks.
