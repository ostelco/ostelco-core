INTRODUCTION
====


This document contains two attempts at generating yaml representations
that would be useful to guide us through the tech due-dil demo.

The steps ahead would be:

  1.  Determine which of these paths to take.
  2.  Separate them into actual yaml files that dan be executed
      using the apply-yaml.sh script
  3.  Implement changes in prime so that the changes are actually done.

The one thing missing in the descriptions below is how to reset the
simulation to its intial state.   We'll fix that in a day or two
tand then we're basically done.
