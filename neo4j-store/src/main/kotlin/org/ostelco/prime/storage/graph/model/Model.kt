/*
  This are the Neo4jStore's internal entity classes, which are almost similar to their prime model's counterparts.
  These classes have been given the same name of their prime model's counterparts as a convention.
  These classes exists because for some of the prime model's entity classes cannot be stored as it is in Neo4j.
  Some of the reasons why that is done so is:
  1. A single class in prime model gets split into 2 classes in Graph DB - one for entity and one for relation.
     E.g. [Identity] and [Identifies].
  2. A single class in prime model is composition for multiple entities in Graph DB.
     E.g. [Segment] and [Offer].
  3. Graph DB has partial information compared to prime model's class.
     E.g. [SimProfile] in Graph DB does not have SimStatus and ActivationCode, which is stored in Sim Manager.
