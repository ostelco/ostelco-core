## Testing

### Setup

 * Configure firebase project - `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
 
 * Save `prime-service-account.json` in all folders where this file is added in `.gitignore`.  You can find these directories by
   executing the command:

```bash
grep -i prime-service-account $(find . -name '.gitignore') | awk -F: '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | sed 's/.gitignore//g'
```     
 
 * Create self-signed certificate for nginx with domain as `ocs.dev.ostelco.org` and place them at following location:
   * In `certs/ocs.dev.ostelco.org`, keep `nginx.key` and `nginx.cert`.
   * In `ocsgw/cert`, keep `ocs.cert`.

```bash
cd certs/ocs.dev.ostelco.org
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ./nginx.key -out ./nginx.crt -subj '/CN=ocs.dev.ostelco.org'
cp nginx.crt ../../ocsgw/cert/ocs.crt
``

 * Set Stripe API key as env variable - `STRIPE_API_KEY`.   Note: It is the key denoted as "Secret key" that shuld
   be set in this env variable.

 * Set Stripe Enpoint Secret (for Stripe events) as env variable - `STRIPE_ENDPOINT_SECRET`
 
 If Stripe events is not enabled the `STRIPE_ENDPOINT_SECRET` env variable can be set to a random string.
 
 To enable Stripe events: 
 
 1. Configure Stripe by adding Primes endpoint for Stripe events to the Stripe event configuration (webhook).
 2. Set the `STRIPE_ENDPOINT_SECRET` to the secret generated by Stripe.
 
 For dev the current configured endpoint for Stripe events is:
 
     https://alvin-api.dev.ostelco.org/stripe/events
 
 Endpoint for prod will be added later.

### Test acceptance-tests

```bash
cd acceptance-tests
gradlew clean build  
docker-compose up --build --abort-on-container-exit
```    

#### Verify Scan information data

Acceptance tests will create few encrypted zip files, these can be verified by running the `__testDecryption()` method in `ScanInfostore.kt`.
- Download encrypted files created in the root folder of prime docker image.
- Find files by logging into the docker image `docker exec -ti prime bash`.
- Copy files from docker image using `docker cp prime:/global_f1a6a509-7998-405c-b186-08983c91b422 .`
- Replace the path for the input files in the method & run. It will create a `decrypted.zip` output file.
- Manually decompress and verify the contents.
